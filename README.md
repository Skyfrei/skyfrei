### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who worked with android technologies at the beginning of my career. Lately I have been a huge fan of C#. I am currently using C# in a lot of projects such as, Unity, WPF desktop apps and Xamarine. 

I have strong interests in:

My programming tools are mainly:

ãƒ»C# / C++ / Kotlin - General purpose languages

ãƒ»Unity / Godot - Game engines

My interest is growing for:
